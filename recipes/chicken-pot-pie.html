        <h4>Delicious chicken pot pie with a buttery, flakey crust</h4>

        <p>Growing up I loved those frozen chicken pot pies you'd get at the store, but I knew they were super unhealthy and loaded with
            saturated and trans fats. As an adult I wanted to try and recreated a chicken pot pie just as delicious as I remembered the
            frozen versions being, and boy did I find <em>just</em> the recipe! This chicken pot pie is thick, creamy, full of flavor, and
            the crust is SO flakey and buttery.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/easy-pie-crust-recipe/" rel noreferrer>Homemade Pie Crust</a>, split in 2</li>
            <li>4 cups of uncooked chicken, shredded (Tip: Use a whole rotisserie chicken!)</li>
            <li>6 tbsp of salted butter</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>8oz white or crimini mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups of chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tsp fine sea salt, plus kosher salt to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper, plus more to garnish</li>
            <li>1 cup of frozen peas</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of parsley, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten, for egg wash</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a dutch oven or large sauce pan, melt 6 tbsp of butter. Add diced onions and carrots and saute
                for 8 minutes over medium high heat until soft.</li>
            <li>Add sliced mushrooms and minced garlic. Saute another 5 minutes until mushrooms are softened.</li>
            <li>Add 1/3 cup flour and stir constantly for 2 minutes until the flour particles are completely mixed in.
                Add chicken stock, and 1/2 cup heavy cream, then bring to a simmer and cook 1 minute or until mixture
                has thickened. Add 2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper.</li>
            <li>Add shredded, cooked chicken, frozen peas, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Stir to combine then remove from
                heat and cool slightly while you roll out the pie dough. Roll 1 chilled pie dough disk into a 12" diameter circle.
                Carefully transfer it into a deep 9" pie dish. Spoon the pie filling into the dish.
                </li>
            <li>Roll the second disk of pie dough into a 10" diameter circle and place over the pie filling. Fold the excess
                dough behind the bottom crust then crimp the pie dough together to seal. Use a sharp paring knife to cut 5 small slits
                in the top to allow steam to escape. Brush the top of the crust with the beaten egg and sprinkle lightly with coarse
                salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake at 425ยบ for 30-35 minutes, or until top crust is golden brown. If edges are browning too fast, cover with a pie
                shield or make a shield by cutting strips of foil and wrapping them around the edges of the pie. Once out of the oven,
                rest for 15 minutes to cool slightly before slicing.
            </li>
