        <h4>Creamy pumpkin sausage soup with mushrooms, pepperjack, and cheddar cheese</h4>

        <p>When it comes to fall I am ALL ABOUT everything pumpkin. My wife gets tired of it much quicker than me, but this soup is a game changer.
            The pumpkin is much more subtle than other pumpkin-based recipes. The combo of pumpkin, italian sausage, and cheddar/pepperjack makes 
            this recipe <em>so</em> rich and savory. It's a hit with pumpkin lovers and haters alike.

            <li>1/2 tsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded pepperjack cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a dutch oven or cast iron combo cooker cook the sausage, mushrooms and onion over medium high heat until
                sausage is no longer pink and vegetables are tender, about 8-10 minutes, breaking up the sausage into crumbles;
                drain. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add chicken stock, pumpkin, sugar, and seasonings. Bring to a boil then
                reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in cream. In a small bowl mix the cold water and cornstarch until smooth. Quickly stir into pan before they
                separate. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Add the cheese and cook/stir until the
                cheese is melted.
            </li>
