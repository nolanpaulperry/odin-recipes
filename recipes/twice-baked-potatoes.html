        <h4>Cheesy and savory twice-baked potatoes.</h4>

        <p>Like most of you, I'm sure, I've always had a soft spot for comfort food, and these twice-baked potatoes definitely
            deserve that title. Buttery mashed potatoes, cheese, sour cream, BACON. All in one compact dish? What more could you
            ask for!? Fun fact: the first time I made these I accidentally added double the amount of cheese and sour cream, since
            I was halving the recipe. I was so mad at myself at first, but my wife encouraging me, saying she was sure they'd still
            be delicious. Spoiler alert; they were. And now I always make them with extra cheese and sour cream, because let's be honest
            here, more the merrier in that department.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>8 slices of bacon</li>
            <li>1 cup of sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
            <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>8 green onions, sliced, divided</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients and preheat oven to 350ยบ F</li>
            <li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size
                of your potatoes. Set potatoes aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown.
                Drain, crumble, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save the skins</li>
            <li>Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions
                to the potato; mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.</li>
            <li>Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon.</li>
            <li>Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Serve hot!</li>
